#Swift Calculator
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zxaos/swift-calc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zxaos/swift-calc)

This is a simple iOS calculator app written in Swift 1.2 for the Stanford Phone App Development course (CS 193P). It covers assignments 1 and 2.

The assignment is intended to demonstrate the basics of the Swift language, Auto Layout, and MVC.

The tests for this assignment are written using Quick and Nimble, so if you are intending to run the test don't forget to clone recursively (`git clone --recursive`) so that you get the necessary submodules to run the tests.
